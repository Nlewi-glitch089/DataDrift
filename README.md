# Description: 
DataDrift is a location-based delivery tracker that generates a secure password for users to access estimated package arrival times using real-time API data.

# Purpose/Problem Statement
DataDrift is a simple program that helps users figure out when their package will arrive by using a location-based API. It addresses the common frustration of not knowing the status or estimated arrival time of a delivery, especially for people who don’t want to keep checking emails or tracking links.

# Target Audience
The target audience includes online shoppers—particularly students, young adults, and busy individuals—who frequently order packages and want a fast, simple way to track delivery timing.

# Solution + Limitations
The program generates a temporary password that allows users to securely access package information based on their location. It uses an API to gather real-time data and makes tracking more accessible.
# Limitations: 
It doesn’t show exact package locations or offer real-time updates. Also, users can’t input their specific tracking numbers—it gives general delivery info based on location, not specific carriers.

# Key Features / Key Components
Password Generator: Provides a one-time password for user access.

# Location-Based API: 
Pulls delivery estimate data based on the user’s city or zip code.

# User Input System: 
Users can enter their location to receive results.

# Text Display:
Clean, readable output that shows estimated delivery information.

# Technical Challenges + Future Plans
# Challenges:

Figuring out how to use an API key correctly and keep it secure.

Getting the API to return data that could be used in a readable way for users.

# Future Plans:

Allow users to enter tracking numbers for more specific results.

Add real-time tracking maps.

Make the interface more interactive and user-friendly.

# Project Timeline
